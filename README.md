# News Explorer

This is the frontend portion of my news search engine. Users can navigate to search various news articles all over the internet. Upon searching, users can save the article to their favorites and remove them later. A user must create a login in order to save articles, however, any user will be able to perform a search.

The frontend was developed using ReactJS and requests are sent to NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/) for news articles. User account related requests are handled by a custom built API; this includes signup/signin and storing a users' saved articles.
